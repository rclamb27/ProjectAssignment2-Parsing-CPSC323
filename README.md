## Group: Ryan Lamb, Miguel Bunag, Troy Lee

To use, run the program and enter a string of characters when prompted. After this, the program shows parsing actions- including each step for the stack. At the end, the string will be indicated as valid or invalid.  

The code is written in Python and uses a stack data structure to keep track of the parsing progress. The grammar and predictive parsing table were hard-coded to match what was given. 

run code: python ./parsing.py
